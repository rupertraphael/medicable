### Background Environment
A medium-sized medical clinic with multiple doctors for various specializations on-site, has contracted our firm, Medicable, to build a new, more efficient interface for their medical appointment booking system. Their clinic used to be small, and they already had a system in place for scheduling appointments. However, after a recent expansion, they are now big enough to necessitate a better system because their current system cannot handle the volume of patients.

Their existing appointment scheduling system is inconsistent and consists of the fact that the front-line staff has to manually look for the patient’s file in the database to confirm if they are an existing patient; they also have to dynamically parse through the doctors’ schedules to check what times are available for the patients. Their existing system is complex and lacks a good user experience and has to be replaced with a better, more efficient system for appointment bookings. Since it contains all the patient files and the doctors’ information, the back-end system however, is good enough and is not required to be replaced. 


### System Use and General Expectations System Should Satisfy
The system should aid users in booking and keeping track of appointments for doctors and patients; as well as make the general process easy and efficient for the users. 

Specifically, the system should allow users that will interact with it to:
- Book appointments
- Manage patient files
- Manage appointments.


### System Constraints
The system will have various different constraints:
Amount of concurrent users will be [#], as the clinic size is fairly small
Interface will be catered only to front-line workers or receptionists, and patients should not be using the system.


### Expected Types of Users
We are developing a medical appointment booking system for front-line workers at medical clinics. Hence, the system will be primarily used by frontline medical staff, such as nurses, doctors and especially, receptionists. 

We expect the users to:
– have computer literacy,
– be accustomed to using medical terms, 
– be familiar with the clinic, and
– be authorized to use the system.

Patients will not be the ones directly interacting with the interface.


### Work Contexts
The general work setting for the users would be sitting in the front desk of a medical clinic or another clinic focused on specific specializations. They would be dealing with patients face to face, and would be booking/managing appointments on the spot. Typical situations for the users would be include:
Seeing a patient walk into the clinic and book an appointment for them.
Rescheduling a patient’s appointment to another date and time. 
Cancelling an appointment due to a patient’s unavailability.
