#Background Environment
A medium-sized medical clinic with multiple doctors for various specializations on-site, has contracted our firm, Medicable, to build a new, more efficient interface for their medical appointment booking system. Their clinic used to be small, and they already had a system in place for scheduling appointments. However, after a recent expansion, they are now big enough to necessitate a better system because their current system cannot handle the volume of patients.

Their existing appointment scheduling system is inconsistent and consists of the fact that the front-line staff has to manually look for the patient’s file in the database to confirm if they are an existing patient; they also have to dynamically parse through the doctors’ schedules to check what times are available for the patients. Their existing system is complex and lacks a good user experience and has to be replaced with a better, more efficient system for appointment bookings. Since it contains all the patient files and the doctors’ information, the back-end system however, is good enough and is not required to be replaced.
